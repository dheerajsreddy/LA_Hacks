Using the first image (the base room) and the second image (the carpet sample), generate a new image.
The new image should show the base room, but with the entire visible floor area realistically replaced by a carpet matching the style, dark grey color, and plush texture shown in the second image (carpet sample).
Maintain the original room's perspective, lighting, and other furniture/objects.
